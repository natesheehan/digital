As the autumnal day unfolded, I gazed out across the horizon and witnessed the essence of a November morning. The weather played the role of a fickle lover, the sky oscillating between moody showers and seductive sunshine, as rainbows painted the sky with hope. To create beauty, every element must be present.

At my feet, our faithful dog locked eyes with me, her piercing brown pupils reflecting my hunched position on the sofa. Her yearning for a walk was palpable and irresistible. I donned my boots, placed my hat firmly on my head, and packed my swimming shorts into a rucksack. As I stepped outside, the wind swaddled me in a chilling embrace, crunching fallen oak leaves beneath my boots.

Together, we made our way to the quarry - a familiar path to my loyal companion. South Cornwall remains littered with quarries from its mining past, each with its own history and character. Lou Lou navigated the winding roads like a seasoned pro, while I trailed behind, grateful for her guidance.

As we reached the public footpath, another man and his collie crossed our path. “Aren’t dey tha best,” he proclaimed in his thick Cornish accent, referencing the working dogs popular among Cornish farmers. Lou Lou slipped from my grip to greet the other collie in a playful canine dance. As the two dogs frolicked, their tails wagging uncontrollably, the man shared stories of an old lady with a collie who couldn't match its energy. Despite her daily walks, the collie was overweight and could barely support itself on its hind legs. “Give me dat dog for a year, dear,” the man had said, “and he’ll be back lookin like a collie should.”

As we parted ways, Lou Lou and I continued on, the public footpath now flooded from the rain. Water seeped into my boots, filling my socks like water balloons. Now off her leash, Lou Lou ran ahead, unfazed by the rugged landscape, while I carefully navigated the terrain.

We finally arrived at the quarry, surrounded by pumpkin orange rock and filled with clear water. I teased Lou Lou by throwing a stick into the water, testing her bravery. She stared at me unamused, uninterested in my attempts at play. I stripped off and put on my swimming shorts, bracing myself for the icy liquid that would soon paint my bare skin with its numbing brush. I jumped from the slippery rock, submerging myself in the water, my heart pounding with excitement. Treading water, I playfully pretended to struggle against one of Cornwall’s mythical aquatic creatures, but Lou Lou remained unimpressed.

As the sky turned a metallic grey, the clouds poured, rippling perfect circles on the surface of the water. I shivered from the cold, jumping out of the water and rubbing my towel vigorously against my body. Lou Lou licked me, her wet nose against my skin, perhaps trying to warm me up or perhaps simply curious about the taste of water.

Dressed, but barefoot, I tied my shoes to my rucksack, my feet connecting me to the earth. Lou Lou and I climbed to the top of the quarry and sat on the highest rock, taking in the breathtaking view of the horizon. It was an autumnal day, and as I looked across the landscape, I couldn't help but feel the quintessential characteristics of being in awe of existence. The rain had washed away my worries, and the beauty of nature surrounded me like a warm embrace.
